A program to stream video from a webcam to the [Peggy 2] [1] via [i2c] [2] on the [BeagleBone Black] [3].
Currently it's more of an ASCII-cam, since i2c output isn't implemented, but [terminal preview of video] [5] feed is.

A re-implementation of the method used in [Video Peggy in action] [4] without the laptop and Arduino.
